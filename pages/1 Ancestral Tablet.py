人有三魂七魄，人往生后，一魂归大地，一魂归身体，而最后一魂则归与神主牌。\n
神主牌是一个方法留住祖先的魂，让他们陪伴及保佑我们。\n
It was said that human has 3 souls. When they passed away, 
one of the soul return to the earth, another return to the body,
and the last one lives in the ancestral tablet. \n
The Ancestral Tablet is a way to let our ancestor remain in the mortal realm close 
to us so that they can be close to our side and protect us from bad luck and curses.
